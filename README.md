Video Template Editor V0.5
A modern, browser-based video template editor built with React and TypeScript. This application enables Template Admins to create video-based templates and provides End Users with tools to customize them for social media content creation.
🎯 Project Overview
Problem Statement
Businesses need to create dynamic video content for social media platforms, but current tools either lack brand control (like Canva) or require complex technical skills. This editor bridges that gap by providing template-based video creation with built-in brand consistency.
Key Benefits

Brand Control: Maintain consistent brand presentation across all video content
Workflow Efficiency: Unified platform for both static and video content creation
User-Friendly: Intuitive interface for users without video editing experience
Template-Based: Reusable templates ensure brand guidelines compliance

🔧 Technical Implementation
Video Processing
The application uses browser-native APIs for video processing:
typescript// Video thumbnail generation
const generateVideoThumbnail = (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const video = document.createElement('video');
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    video.onloadedmetadata = () => {
      canvas.width = 400;
      canvas.height = Math.round((400 * video.videoHeight) / video.videoWidth);
      video.currentTime = Math.min(1, video.duration * 0.1);
    };
    
    video.onseeked = () => {
      ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
      resolve(canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.8));
    };
    
    video.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
  });
};
State Management
The application uses React's built-in state management:
typescript// Main project state
const [project, setProject] = useState<VideoProject>({
  id: 'project_1',
  name: 'Untitled Project',
  dimensions: PROJECT_SIZES[0],
  videos: [],
  settings: {
    autoPlay: false,
    quality: '1080p',
    exportFormat: 'mp4'
  }
});

// Undo/Redo implementation
const [undoStack, setUndoStack] = useState<VideoProject[]>([]);
const [redoStack, setRedoStack] = useState<VideoProject[]>([]);
Export System
The export system simulates video processing with realistic progress:
typescriptconst handleExport = async () => {
  const stages = [
    'Preparing video timeline...',
    'Processing video clips...',
    'Applying effects and filters...',
    'Encoding to MP4...',
    'Optimizing file size...',
    'Finalizing export...'
  ];

  for (let i = 0; i < stages.length; i++) {
    setCurrentStage(stages[i]);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 800));
    setExportProgress(((i + 1) / stages.length) * 100);
  }
};
🎨 Design System
Color Palette
css:root {
  --primary: #8B5CF6;        /* Purple - CTAs and active states */
  --secondary: #F8FAFC;      /* Light gray - backgrounds */
  --accent: #3B82F6;         /* Blue - timeline and interactive elements */
  --muted: #F3F4F6;          /* Subtle backgrounds */
  --border: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); /* Subtle borders */
}
Component Guidelines

Rounded corners: 6px standard, 12px for cards
Spacing: 4px grid system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32px)
Typography: Inter font family with consistent hierarchy
Shadows: Subtle for elevation, more pronounced for modals
Animations: 200ms duration, ease-in-out timing

🧪 Testing
Manual Testing Checklist

 Video upload works with drag-and-drop and file picker

 Playback controls respond correctly (play, pause, scrub)
 Property changes update video in real-time
 Undo/redo works for all actions
 Export modal shows progress and completes successfully
 Responsive design works on different screen sizes
 Keyboard shortcuts function as expected

Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome 90+
✅ Firefox 88+
✅ Safari 14+
✅ Edge 90+

🛠️ Development Guidelines
Code Style

Use TypeScript for all new code
Follow React hooks patterns
Implement proper error boundaries
Use semantic HTML elements
Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

Component Structure
typescriptinterface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleEvent = useCallback(() => {
    // Implementation
  }, []);
  
  // Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
  }, []);
  
  // Render
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
Performance Considerations

Use useCallback for event handlers
Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
Lazy load components when appropriate
Optimize video file handling with proper cleanup
Use proper React keys for list items
